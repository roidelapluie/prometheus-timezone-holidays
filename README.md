# Prometheus & Alertmanager business hours support

This repo contains example configuration that we use to provide timezone and
public-holidays aware alerts to Prometheus and Alertmanager.

This material was presented at [PromCon
2019](https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/improved-alerting-with-prometheus-and-alertmanager/).

This repo contains a promtheus & alertmanager configuration, along with a file
that contains rules for Belgian timezone and Public Holidays.

The Easter calculation was found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus).
